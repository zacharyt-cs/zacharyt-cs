- 👋 Hi, I’m Zachary!
- 👀 I’m interested in data tools and data pipelines so that data can be better utilised and understood.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Airflow, Spark, DBT, and also becoming more proficient in Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I enjoy watching the NBA, listening to podcasts, and strumming away on my guitar!
